Hey there! We're excited that you're interested in contributing.
Before sending a pull request, please take a moment to read this quick guide:

## Sending Pull Requests

### Discuss First
Since the project only accepts **bug fixes**, please open an issue first to describe the problem and confirm that it needs a fix. This helps avoid unnecessary work for both sides.

For small documentation or typo corrections, feel free to group them into a single PR to keep the history clean.

### Commit Convention
We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).
For this project, relevant types are:

- `fix:` — for actual bug fixes
- `docs:` — for documentation or typo fixes
- `chore:` — for small internal or tooling updates

Avoid using `feat:` — new features aren’t accepted.

### Pull Request
If you're new to PRs, GitHub has a great [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

When opening a PR:

- Make sure your title follows the commit convention.
- If your PR fixes an issue, add this in the description:

```
fix #123
```

No need to squash your commits — we’ll do that on merge.
And of course, please test your changes before submitting.
